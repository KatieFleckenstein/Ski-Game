The ski game is designed like a ski racer going down the mountain around gates using the keyboard arrow keys. My idea behind the game was to make it like the game Temple Run, with an overhead view of the runner swerving around obstacles. Being a computer game,  In the ski game, it is the same view from above but is instead of a skier turning around gates. Initially, Claude.ai did not understand what a "skier" or "gate" was, so I had to learn how to properly communicate my ideas more simply. Another command that Claude did not understand was the boundaries and spacing, and if I did not specify them , the gates ended up too close to the edge of the frame for the "skier" to go around. The most complex command that I included was adding coins to the game, which sadly did not work all of the time. At the beginning, the coins were on the correct line for the skier to collect, but as the game went on they got further away so it became impossible to collect them. While using Claude.ai, I realized how specific my instructions needed to be, and what the program was/ was unable to understand.
